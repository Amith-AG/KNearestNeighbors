# KNearestNeighbors

This code is an example of using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify a dataset. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

Start: This is just a comment indicating the start of the code.

Load necessary libraries: The required libraries, including pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection, and KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors, are imported.

Import 'diabetes.csv' file: The code assumes there is a file named 'diabetes.csv' in the current directory, which is then loaded in the next step.

Read csv file: The data from the 'diabetes.csv' file is read into a pandas DataFrame called 'diabetes'.

Print columns of diabetes file: The code prints the column names of the 'diabetes' DataFrame.

Create training and test split: The data is split into training and test sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn. The 'Outcome' column is used as the target variable, and the remaining columns are used as the features. The stratify parameter ensures that the class distribution is maintained in both the training and test sets.

Try N_neighbors from 1 to 10: The code defines a range of values for k (the number of neighbors) from 1 to 10.

Build the model: The code iterates over the range of k values and creates a KNeighborsClassifier model with each k value. The model is then fitted to the training data.

Record training set accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the training set is calculated using the score method and appended to the 'training_accuracy' list.

Record test set accuracy: The accuracy of the model on the test set is calculated using the score method and appended to the 'test_accuracy' list.

Plot training accuracy and test accuracy: The training and test accuracies for each k value are plotted using matplotlib.

Print training accuracy and test accuracy: The training and test accuracies for each k value are printed.

Stop: This is just a comment indicating the end of the code.

Overall, the code performs KNN classification on the 'diabetes' dataset for different values of k and evaluates the performance by plotting the accuracy and printing the results.
